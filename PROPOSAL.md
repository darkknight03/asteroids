Put your final project proposal here.

For my final project, I want to create a game that is similar to the game Asteroids. It will have user-controlled spaceship that can shoot lasers(moving particles) at other ships moving down the screen. The enemy ships will move from left to right, then down and right to left until it reaches the bottome of the screen. Once the ships reach the bottom of the screen, the player will lose lives. The goal of for the player to shoot down the enemy ships before it reaches the bottom of the screen. There will be multiple levels where the number of hits to eliminate the enemy will increase.

I think this is a pretty cool game to burn some time when I'm free. I played a game similiar to this on long distance plane trips to visit my cousins in India and Australia and this game made the time go by a little faster. 

By the end of the week two, I will have created the user spaceship with buttons corresponding to movement and shooting. I will also have designed the enemy spaceships with automatic movement moving down the screen. I will begin to start working on changing the level and icnreasing the difficulty each time the user destroys all the enemy ships. If I were to finish the project early, I could implement a boss level that shoots particle down on the user.
