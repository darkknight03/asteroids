For my final project, I want to create a game that is similar to the game Asteroids. It will have user-controlled spaceship that can shoot lasers(moving particles) at other ships
moving down the screen. The enemy ships will move from left to right, then down and right to left until it reaches the bottome of the screen. Once the ships reach the bottom of 
the screen, the player will lose lives. The goal of for the player to shoot down the enemy ships before it reaches the bottom of the screen. There will be multiple levels where 
the number of hits to eliminate the enemy will increase. Also, each time the user destroys an enemy ship, their score increases which could be displayed on the screen in top left 
or right. The top left will include the health of the player as well. 

I think this is a pretty cool game to burn some time when I'm free. I played a game similiar to this on long distance plane trips to visit my cousins in India and Australia and 
this game made the time go by a little faster. I want to make this game because I thought this game was an interesting take on the the popular asteroids arcade game. I don't 
really have much background knowledge in game development but I hope to gain some experience throughout this final project.

By the end of the week two, I will have created the user spaceship with buttons corresponding to movement and shooting. I will also have designed the enemy spaceships with 
automatic movement moving down the screen. I will begin to start working on changing the level and increasing the difficulty each time the user destroys all the enemy ships. If I 
were to finish the project early, I could implement a boss level that shoots particles at the user. Another idea is to implement a scoreboard that keep tracks of the users who 
played previously and keeps their score in a list that gets displayed once the game ends.
